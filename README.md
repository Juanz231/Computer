# The Hack Computer in Java

## Description

Creating the Hack Computer from nand2tetris in Java.

The NAND to Tetris (nand2tetris) project is a fascinating educational journey that takes you from building a computer starting only with the simplest logic gate (NAND gate) all the way up to creating a fully functional computer system. The project is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of how computers work from the ground up.

### How to build the Hack Computer?
Imagine you're building something with Lego blocks. Instead of just putting together a simple building, you're building a computer from scratch. It all starts with the most basic block, called the NAND gate. This is like a fundamental Lego piece that only does one thing: if you give it two inputs, it'll only give an output if both are false.

Now, using these NAND gates, you build more complicated things like NOT, AND, and OR gates. These gates allow you to perform more complex operations with binary data (zeros and ones).

After building these gates, you combine them to make larger circuits, like adders and memory registers. It's like putting different kinds of Lego blocks together to create bigger and more complex shapes.

Finally, when you have enough of these circuits, you assemble them all together to make a Central Processing Unit (CPU). The CPU is like the "brain" of the computer. It's responsible for performing operations and processing data according to the instructions it receives.

So basically, you build the CPU piece by piece, from the simplest NAND gates to the more complex circuits, until you have a fully functional CPU. It's a long and detailed process, but in the end, you gain a deep understanding of how a computer really works.
